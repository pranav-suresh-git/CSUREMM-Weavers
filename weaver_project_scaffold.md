# üß† Scaffolded Project Structure: Modeling Cooperation in Grey-Capped Social Weavers

A modular and ambitious yet tractable breakdown of your group‚Äôs research trajectory ‚Äî blending empirical analysis, evolutionary game theory (EGT), and agent-based modeling (ABM).

## üå± Tier 1: Empirical Foundations (Descriptive + Statistical Modeling)

Grounds theoretical assumptions using observed data patterns.

### 1A. Kinship & Nesting Proximity Correlation
**Q:** Do kin nest closer than non-kin?  
**Quantitative work:** Linear or logistic regression; network assortativity by relatedness.

### 1B. Rainfall & Colony Stability Analysis
**Q:** Does rainfall predict colony fragmentation or group size changes?  
**Quantitative work:** Time-series regression; GLMM with rainfall as predictor.

### 1C. Temporal Stability of Social Units
**Q:** How stable are pairs, triads, or families over time?  
**Quantitative work:** Temporal SRI network analysis; community detection consistency.

### 1D. Clustering Failure as Signal
**Q:** What does poor clustering suggest about social fluidity or overlap?  
**Quantitative work:** Residual analysis from UMAP + K-means; SRI entropy metrics.

## üîÑ Tier 2: Empirically-Constrained Game Theory Modules

Mini-games based on observed variables (e.g., kinship, rainfall), modulating payoffs via ecological logic.

### 2A. Dyadic Kin-Cooperation Game
**Q:** Does cooperation evolve more in kin-dense dyads?  
**Quantitative work:** Simulate simple payoff matrices with kinship modifier; analyze ESS.

### 2B. Rainfall-Modulated Public Goods Game
**Q:** How does rainfall change the incentives for group-level cooperation?  
**Quantitative work:** Payoff matrix simulation under variable rainfall; threshold analysis.

### 2C. ‚ÄúSwitch or Stay‚Äù Migration Game
**Q:** Should individuals switch colonies after disturbance or predation?  
**Quantitative work:** Markov Decision Process (MDP); expected value comparison.

### 2D. Replicator Dynamics Model
**Q:** How does a cooperation strategy propagate under realistic payoffs?  
**Quantitative work:** Replicator equation simulations with data-informed payoffs.

## üß≠ Tier 3: Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs)

Behavioral rules are informed by real social, kinship, and environmental data.

### 3A. Kin-Aware Nesting ABM
**Q:** Do kinship rules drive observed colony structure?  
**Quantitative work:** ABM simulation; track % kin co-residency and spatial clustering.

### 3B. Disturbance-Rainfall ABM with Strategy Updating
**Q:** How do environmental shocks shape strategic evolution?  
**Quantitative work:** ABM with rainfall-disturbance inputs; update strategies via imitation or fitness.

### 3C. Meta-Colony Evolution ABM
**Q:** What governs colony-level success/failure over years?  
**Quantitative work:** High-level ABM treating colonies as agents; track colony lifespan and merging/splitting.

## üß™ Tier 4: Integrative Analysis & Synthesis

Connects simulations and game theory back to real ecological systems.

### 4A. Empirical Validation of ABM Output
**Q:** Do simulation results reproduce observed kin clustering or colony stability?  
**Quantitative work:** Compare network statistics (e.g., clustering coeff., assortativity) across data vs. model.

### 4B. Parameter Sensitivity & Threshold Analysis
**Q:** What ecological or social parameters cause regime shifts in cooperation?  
**Quantitative work:** Sensitivity analysis, bifurcation diagrams, Latin hypercube sampling.

### 4C. Theoretical Synthesis: General Rules of Modular Cooperation
**Q:** What social-ecological rules govern emergent cooperation?  
**Quantitative work:** Cross-model comparative analysis; formulation of generalizable cooperation rules.

### üîç Data Caveats to Consider

- **Rainfall** data is monthly (coarse); good for seasonal vs. dry year trends, not daily dynamics.
- **Disturbance** data (e.g., elephant damage) is sporadic but can be treated as binary shock events.
- **Predation** is sparse ‚Äî best used as a rare-event stressor in simulation scenarios, not for regression.
